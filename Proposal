Proposal

We will make software that allows users to quickly find available time slots for their desired gym equipment and make reservations, which are handled with a database.

DATA:

Type of Station (Bench, Cardio Pod, etc.), # of each type of stations

Time slots for each individual station (and date)

"isTaken" boolean for each station/time

Name for each reservation

Counter for total gym users at each time slot

Track reservations per user over a day

Special equipment (bands, mats, kettle bells, etc)

--- WORKING ON WORD DOCUMENT THROUGH TEAMS INSTEAD, FOR NOW ---
